        <div style='font-size:large; margin-left:15%; margin-right:15%;'>
            <p>I have spent my last two years in Madison, WI. And during this time, I ate at many Indian restaurants around the area. In this blog, I list my favorite places and food items I like in each of them. Hopefully, someone will find tasty food recommendations from this list :).</p>
            <p><i>Note: I eat vegetarian and will focus on vegetarian options in this blog.</i></p>
            
            <h2>Restaurants</h2>
            
            <h3>Dhaba Indian Bistro</h3>
            <p>I love the Tandoori Parathas here. The Tandoori Aloo Paratha and Tandoori Onion Paratha taste good with vegetable dishes or pickles. I also like this restaurant's paneer vegetables, malai kofta, and dal makhani. Lastly, they make great Chai. If you want Indian-style Chai, it is a great choice.</p>

            <h3>Bombay Fast Cafe</h3>
            <p>Bombay Fast Cafe is a food truck located in front of the Memorial Library, along with many other food trucks. All the food trucks are generally open from 11 am-4 pm on weekdays. If you like food trucks or want a quick bite, this is the place to visit. I like Bombay Fast Cafe's Pav Bhaji, Vada Pav, and Bombay Falafel. They also have Chai, but it goes out of stock fast, so visiting them before 1 pm is recommended if you want a cup.</p>

            <h3>Amber Indian Cuisine</h3>
            <p>Amber is famous for its biryani. I love their vegetable biryani. Their chicken biryani is also renowned, as many of my friends love it. Their mango lassi is excellent, and I like their Malai Kofta.</p>

            <h3>The Globe</h3>
            <p>The Globe is located on state street. Its Indian Tic-Tac Curry is excellent. This restaurant knows how to make spicy food, and their 5/5 spice level is hot. But you are in for a treat if you spicy food like me. I also like the Momos here.</p>

            <h3>Maharani Restaurant</h3>
            <p>I did not visit this restaurant as frequently, so I don't have many favorites. But my friend likes the Dal Tadka here. Also, it is near the State Capital building, so it's easier to visit if you live around the area.</p>

            <h3>Swagat Indian Restaurant</h3>
            <p>Swagat has an unlimited buffet from 11 am to 2 pm every Friday to Sunday, so this is the place to go if you are starving some afternoon. The buffet tastes good but isn't anything out of the world. What it does provide is an excellent variety for a fixed price.</p>

            <h2>And Many More..</h2>
            These are my recommendations from the restaurants that I liked in Madison. There are many that I forgot to list and many gems I could not find. Madison weather is harsh during the winters. Hopefully, good food can make up for it. And lastly, during the summer months, don't miss the Memorial Terrace, it's iconic chairs and cheese curds.
